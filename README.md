# Task-7---05-06-2025

This task focuses on auditing browser extensions to identify potential security and performance risks. Using the Brave browser's extension management interface, the user conducted a systematic review of all installed extensions. During this review, unnecessary or redundant extensions were identified, with a particular focus on analyzing their permissions and behaviors.

One of the extensions, Sider Chat, was found to have highly sensitive permissions—specifically, the ability to read browser history—which raised red flags regarding user privacy and data security. After evaluating its necessity and risk, the extension was removed. Post-removal analysis indicated a 20% reduction in browser resource consumption, highlighting the impact such extensions can have on system performance.

The task further explored how malicious extensions operate under the guise of utility tools while engaging in harmful activities like data theft, ad injection, and phishing redirection. These extensions often execute background processes that drain CPU and memory, thereby degrading browser efficiency. Some can even exploit vulnerabilities to compromise the operating system itself. This highlights the importance of proactive extension management and continuous user awareness to foster safer and more efficient web browsing.
